# Reverse Integer

This is the solution for the problem [described here](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

## Example 1

```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

## Example 2

```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```

## Example 3

```
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```
